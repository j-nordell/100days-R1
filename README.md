# 100 Days of Code Challenge - My Journey

---

## The challenge

*The official site can be found [here](https://github.com/j-nordell/100days-R1.git)*

Simply put, the challenge is to code for one hour every day for the next 100 days. But it goes a bit beyond that.

The Rules

- Code for minimum an hour a day
- Tweet your progress daily with the hashtag: #100DaysOfCode
- Each day, reach out to at least two people on Twitter who are also doing the challenge

I'm going to do my best, but at present, I'm not sure how to accomplish the last task as I only know one other person doing the challenge.
