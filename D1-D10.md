# Daily Logs

What I've noticed about myself is that I'm far better about disciplining myself to code every day
than to tweet and journal my coding every day. But surely, if I can do one, I can do the other two, right?
So I'm rebooting this and starting over.

### Before Coding

I felt really good about coding today. Started working on a new website that I need for something.

### What I Did

I had originally planned to do a lot of work with JavaScript today, but in reality, a lot of my work
was with CSS. Specifically, CSS grids and flexbox. I didn't work one hour. I worked *several* hours,
but it felt good to do so.

### Before Coding

Started a new medicine and I'm feeling sort of hyperactive/nervous. I still want to code, though.

### What I Did

Worked on Project 8. For some reason, I'm still experiencing problems concatenating the CSS files. Everything
else seems to be working pretty well thus far.

### After Coding

Slightly tired and still feeling jittery. I'm glad I did at least my one hour. Now to tweet about it!

### Before Coding

Feeling exceptionally jittery and nervous. Hope this goes well.

### What I Did

Worked on a few challenges on Edabit. I feel like it's important to work on my problem-solving
skills. The language will only get you so far.

### After Coding

Got at least 2 challenges done. I could probably do more, but this medicine is throwing me for a loop.

### Before Coding

Had some minor victories at work today, so was feeling pretty decent though the medicine is still tough to deal with.

### What I Did

Worked more on algorithms.

### After Coding

Glad I did this, but will definitely be happy when I feel more centered.

2018-10-10

### Before Coding

Major crisis at work. Need a decision from the leaders but no one has responded. Stressful day.

### What I Did

Worked on Project 8 for my Techdegree.

### After Coding

I actually got some work done. I was a bit surprised by that given how distracted I am so... YAY! :)

## D6

2018-10-11

### Before Coding

Fairly calm day at work. I handled a crisis with grace and relative ease at work once a decision came down. Feeling pretty good.

### What I Did

Continued work on Project 8. This assignment is all about gulp. I was having some issued but seem to have cleared up a few.

### After Coding

Things are progressing and feeling pretty good still.

## D7

2018-10-12

### Before Coding

Decided to cut myself a break if I miss a tweet, but not cut myself a break if I miss two in a row. There should be no excuse for that. Other than that, TGIF!

### What I Did

Today I played with an entirely new website just trying some things out. Tomorrow I will go back to project 8. Just needed a break to play a bit.

### After Coding

Today was a pretty great day. It's Friday, after all! Tomorrow more code and less work! :)

### Before Coding

I'm really not looking forward to working on this particular project. It has been very annoying dealing with versioning issues and I continually face setbacks. Even Googling doesn't help much as the best suggestion seems to be to make an issue with some GitHub repo and I'm not going to do that.

### What I Did

Worked on Project 8 and did get a bit further. Actually pretty pleased with my progress.

### After Coding

I'm glad to have done this and did actually get some stuff done, though I'm ready to move on.

## D9

2018-10-14

### Before Coding

Have had a terrible headache all day that I can't seem to get rid of. I'm really not looking forward to this round.

### What I Did

Continued making progress on Project 8. Just a few finishing touches to add, I believe and, of course, a last check that it meets all requirements.

### After Coding

Mostly tired and in pain, but glad I did it. That's 9 days in a row now. I'm about to hit double digits!

## D10

2018-10-15

### Before Coding

Just a terribly long day at work. I'm very tired but willing to give this a go.

### What I Did

Worked on algorithms today. Got a couple of challenges done. I'm not sure that my solutions are the most effecient, but they work.

### After Coding

Tired, but still feel good about having done this.
