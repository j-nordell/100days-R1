### Before Coding

I'm feeling a bit tired and anxious. I was ill this morning but feeling a bit
better this afternoon. My work schedule has been crazy lately and at this point,
I've already racked up more than one full week of comp time. I was watching one
of the teachers on [Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com) teaching about Python
and they mentioned the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I'm not sure why, but I felt
inspired to give it another shot, so here we go!

### What I Did

First, I set up this repo, but that didn't count towards my hour. I reviewed the
specifications for the thing I'm trying to create. I created routes in Express.js and got
at least the first 2 working correctly. Still more tweaking to do with the pug templates.
There was actually measurable progress today.

### After Coding

Still tired, but I'm glad I did my one hour (at least). I might do some more tonight
if I feel up to it. But I'm calling this a victory.

Things to do for tomorrow:

- Host my first 4 projects as GitHub pages
- Take screenshots of my first 4 projects
- Attempt to narrow in on a color scheme for my site

### Before Coding

I'm still mildly ill. It's getting better, though. Mostly, I'm just tired and
dizzy. I know that today's coding will be about getting my images together and
fleshing out a color scheme. I'm not sure design is my greatest skill. That being
said, I'm still pretty stoked about doing this today because it will be two days
in a row. And even if it's only two days, it's now officially a "streak". So, yay
me!

### What I Did

A good portion of my assets are in place. I spent a while with CSS and trying to get
a reasonable looking color scheme. I'm still not feeling great about my design abilities
but hope I will get there with time. Some are just more naturally inclined, I believe.

### After Coding

Even if design might not really be my thing, I feel good about having put in my hour.
It is a promise I kept to myself. I want to hold myself accountable. Actually, I
need to hold myself accountable. Some opportunites are far too valuable to throw away.

### Before Coding

I'm feeling very frustrated and overwhelemed with my current job. I have to get
a different job. It's actually making me ill at this point. I'm not sure how focused
I am on code right now. I'm just more focused on doing something I love and getting
paid for it(which happens to be coding).

### What I Did

Fought forever trying to figure out why an object was turning up undefined. Classic
typo. Mystery solved. Then I went on to fight an indentation error. It too was solved.
The total time for the mysteries was about 45 minutes.

### After Coding

I've had a horrible day today, but glad that I did at least this much. Maybe tomorrow
will be better. Maybe it won't. But it will be another day of code.
