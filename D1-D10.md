# Daily Logs

What I've noticed about myself is that I'm far better about disciplining myself to code every day
than to tweet and journal my coding every day. But surely, if I can do one, I can do the other two, right?
So I'm rebooting this and starting over.

### Before Coding

I felt really good about coding today. Started working on a new website that I need for something.

### What I Did

I had originally planned to do a lot of work with JavaScript today, but in reality, a lot of my work
was with CSS. Specifically, CSS grids and flexbox. I didn't work one hour. I worked *several* hours,
but it felt good to do so.
