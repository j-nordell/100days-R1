## D1

### Before Coding
I'm feeling a bit tired and anxious. I was ill this morning but feeling a bit
better this afternoon. My work schedule has been crazy lately and at this point,
I've already racked up more than one full week of comp time. I was watching one
of the teachers on [Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com) teaching about Python
and they mentioned the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I'm not sure why, but I felt 
inspired to give it another shot, so here we go!

### What I Did

First, I set up this repo, but that didn't count towards my hour. I reviewed the 
specifications for the thing I'm trying to create. I created routes in Express.js and got
at least the first 2 working correctly. Still more tweaking to do with the pug templates.
There was actually measurable progress today.

### After Coding

Still tired, but I'm glad I did my one hour (at least). I might do some more tonight
if I feel up to it. But I'm calling this a victory.

Things to do for tomorrow:
- Host my first 4 projects as GitHub pages
- Take screenshots of my first 4 projects
- Attempt to narrow in on a color scheme for my site
