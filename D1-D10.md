### Before Coding

I'm feeling a bit tired and anxious. I was ill this morning but feeling a bit
better this afternoon. My work schedule has been crazy lately and at this point,
I've already racked up more than one full week of comp time. I was watching one
of the teachers on [Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com) teaching about Python
and they mentioned the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I'm not sure why, but I felt
inspired to give it another shot, so here we go!

### What I Did

First, I set up this repo, but that didn't count towards my hour. I reviewed the
specifications for the thing I'm trying to create. I created routes in Express.js and got
at least the first 2 working correctly. Still more tweaking to do with the pug templates.
There was actually measurable progress today.

### After Coding

Still tired, but I'm glad I did my one hour (at least). I might do some more tonight
if I feel up to it. But I'm calling this a victory.

Things to do for tomorrow:

- Host my first 4 projects as GitHub pages
- Take screenshots of my first 4 projects
- Attempt to narrow in on a color scheme for my site

### Before Coding

I'm still mildly ill. It's getting better, though. Mostly, I'm just tired and
dizzy. I know that today's coding will be about getting my images together and
fleshing out a color scheme. I'm not sure design is my greatest skill. That being
said, I'm still pretty stoked about doing this today because it will be two days
in a row. And even if it's only two days, it's now officially a "streak". So, yay
me!

### What I Did

A good portion of my assets are in place. I spent a while with CSS and trying to get
a reasonable looking color scheme. I'm still not feeling great about my design abilities
but hope I will get there with time. Some are just more naturally inclined, I believe.

### After Coding

Even if design might not really be my thing, I feel good about having put in my hour.
It is a promise I kept to myself. I want to hold myself accountable. Actually, I
need to hold myself accountable. Some opportunites are far too valuable to throw away.

### Before Coding

I'm feeling very frustrated and overwhelemed with my current job. I have to get
a different job. It's actually making me ill at this point. I'm not sure how focused
I am on code right now. I'm just more focused on doing something I love and getting
paid for it(which happens to be coding).

### What I Did

Fought forever trying to figure out why an object was turning up undefined. Classic
typo. Mystery solved. Then I went on to fight an indentation error. It too was solved.
The total time for the mysteries was about 45 minutes.

### After Coding

I've had a horrible day today, but glad that I did at least this much. Maybe tomorrow
will be better. Maybe it won't. But it will be another day of code.

### Before Coding

Last night after I finsihed my one hour of "required" coding, I still wanted to code more.
So I did!. I wasn't feeling exceptionally motivated rather I just had small ideas that
came to me here and there but it felt easier to open this editor and just try them
immediately than wait. So today, I'm feeling really good about coding

### What I Did

Made new screenshots of my projects and made sure that the live versions are actually
working and live. Then I started going out of my way to make errors because today was
largely about handling errors and my error.pug. I love to be playing with JavaScript!

### After Coding

I feel like I could code some more. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't. But I feel good that
I at least did my one hour minimum!

### Before Coding

Before I got started coding today, I spent a good bit of time at my workplace making up for some lost time I had when I was sick last week. Things need to get done, you know. So when I sat down to do my one hour tonight, I was not feeling great about getting started.

### What I Did

I tackled a bug with my error routing that has been haunting me for a few days now. My custom 404 route was showing up on everything except in one place. But I figured it out! After a fairly sophisticated integrity check on the request parameters, I used `res.redirect`. Now everything is running smoothly.

### After Coding

I was tired from my day at work. But after a big victory at work and a big victory with my code, I feel ready to code some more! To be honest, I put in over one hour today.

2018-09-10

### Before Coding

Today, I had a few small victories at work, but they were not easily won victories which left me very tired. Also, I know that today my coding will mostly consist of making sure everything is commented properly and my README.md is all up to date. Not exciting, but still needs to be done.

### What I Did

So, I did catch up on my code commenting. Everything is nicely spaced and mostly conforms to eslint standards for AirBNB. There are a few exceptions, but very few. I updated my two markdown files to reflect my progress on the project. While testing for cross-browser compatibility, I stumbled upon an extreme corner case where a route was not handled properly in the case that the user prefixed a number with 0 which makes it octal in JS. That is now gracefully handled as well.

### After Coding

I'm glad I did this. This project is almost ready for submission. I am, of course, aiming for "Exceeds", as usual. Ultimately, I feel like a lot was accomplished in a very short amount of time. I feel inspired to do more and, in fact, might do the final tweaks on some assets and maybe, just maybe... add some cool transitions in CSS. We'll see

### Before Coding

I had a long, but relatively calm day at work and got a lot done. It was raining here which always makes me sleepy, but I sat down to my project to do my one hour anyway. I mostly felt somewhat neutral going into it.

### What I Did

None of my code was terribly exciting. I mostly cleaned up spacing, adjusted some CSS and fixed got some better assets needed for a couple of my pages. Some of it wasn't exactly coding
but still much needed work to get this project submitted and potentially live soon. I have asked for others to review it now in hopes of catching any bugs I might have missed.

### After Coding

I feel calm and am already looking forward to starting the next project. I hope there aren't too many remaining bugs to deal with.

2018-09-12

### Before Coding

Lots done at work today and I'm feeling pretty good about that. Big announcement from Apple tonight wasn't that big of an announcement. There wasn't much
that directly affects my job. I've submitted my project for review.

### What I Did

Today was mainly about getting the markdown on the README.md and grading-requirments.md set up for the next project and reviewing the specifications. I did do some
work with gulp but not a lot.

### After Coding

My project 8 will be off to a good start after this evening. I'm nervous about the results of Project 7. I don't like people looking at my code.

## D9

2018-09-13

### Before Coding

Not only did I forget to commit the changes from last night, I also forgot to Tweet this out. Waiting for my project results has my mind a bit scattered. Still, I'm going to do my coding for today as usual.

### What I Did

Had to correct the markdown in the README.md. I forgot to add a blank space between the square brackets so that tasks will appear as an unchecked box. Then I got to work on
project 8 which is all about gulp. My JS files are concatenating and minifying fine, but my CSS module is not working. Some node version issue?  I'm not sure. Something to look at tomorrow.

### After Coding

Still worried that I haven't received the results of my project. I think I'll feel better about moving on once I get my grade back.
