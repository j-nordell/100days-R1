### Before Coding
I'm feeling a bit tired and anxious. I was ill this morning but feeling a bit
better this afternoon. My work schedule has been crazy lately and at this point,
I've already racked up more than one full week of comp time. I was watching one
of the teachers on [Treehouse](https://www.teamtreehouse.com) teaching about Python
and they mentioned the #100DaysOfCode challenge. I'm not sure why, but I felt 
inspired to give it another shot, so here we go!
