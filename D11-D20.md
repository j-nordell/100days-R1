# Days 11 - 20

2018-10-16

### Before Coding

Some small victories at work today. Nothing too stressful. Feeling fairly good about this coding part.

### What I Did

Worked on a FCC project for a bit. All tests passing but need to fill in further information and style the page.

### After Coding

Happy that all tests are passing. One more thing done.

### Before Coding

Fairly calm at work today. Mostly some monitoring of services and documentation.

### What I Did

Worked a bit on the UI to my new database. Still not exactly sure how I want it to look/work. But progress.

### After Coding

Feeling pretty calm. Wish I had a better idea of what I want the end result to look like. Maybe I need to brainstorm some more.

### Before Coding

Feeling jittery. This new medicine doesn't really agree with me.

### What I Did

Worked on styling for the FCC project I'm on. Trying to keep up with a friend who is doing the same curriculum.

### After Coding

Not feeling particularly motivated about anything, but likely due to the medicine.

2018-10-19

### Before Coding

Doctor has ordered that I stop the current medicine and begin with a new one tomorrow. This makes me nervous,
but I'm hoping it works out.

### What I Did

More work on project 8. I'm at the point where I'm doing the code to optimize the pictures to be used on the site.
It's actually relatively interesting.

### After Coding

Glad I did this, but I'm exhausted. Something has to change with my health.

2018-10-20

### Before Coding

It's Saturday and I don't have to worry about work. First day of the new medicine and I suppose 
we'll see how it goes.

### What I Did

More work with algorithms. Another couple of challenges kicked to the curb, though one was pretty tough.

### After Coding

I just generically feel like I wish I were smarter. But I'm glad I worked on these. Could be helpful if I ever
make it to a technical interview.

2018-10-21

### Before Coding

I have a massive headache that will not go away. I feel like it can't be due to the new medicine. I just started taking
it. That seems absurd. But still... it's heree.

### What I Did

Mostly played with the layout for my FCC project. It's hard to think with a headache this bad.

### After Coding

Tired and going to crash. That's it, folks.
