### Before Coding

Feeling pretty relaxed. It's Saturday and I have coffee. Not much to complain about. I'm going into this round feeling fairly neutral.

### What I Did

I worked primarily on Project 8 for the Techdegree but also got a tip about a possible outside resource that I intend to look at later. I feel like the project is going well although I have had some issues with certain modules not wanting to run with the current version of Node.js

### After Coding

I feel like maybe I could have gotten more done, but I also feel like it's not so much my code as getting the different versions of things to work together properly. I still feel good that I did my one hour of code.

### Before Coding

I'm feeling like I need to do something different for today just to change it up a bit.

### What I Did

I decided to spend today working on algorithms and went to work on Edabit some. I got a couple of challenges completed and am feeling pretty good about that.

### After Coding

It was nice to have a day away from gulp and work with algorithms.

### Before Coding

Back to gulp and figuring out this versioning nonsense. I'm not looking forward to it, but I know that I need to press through this and others have done it, so I can too!

### What I Did

Worked with Node.js and gulp trying to get the `gulp-sass` module to work properly. No success yet. Might have to switch to something else. One of its dependencies is deprecated.

### After Coding

Still a bit frustrated with this project, but I'm glad that I put in my one hour. At least I know the source of the problem now. I thought it was my code. It isn't.

### Before Coding

Had a pretty terrific day at work today so I'm feeling good about coding. That being said, today I will be working on remodelling a database I designed and have had in production for over 2 years. However, the information I'm tracking with the database is changing dramatically and I need to redo/rethink how the db is designed.

### What I Did

Quite a bit of data modelling and working with MySQL workbench checking how things will connect to each other. I need the connections to be "looser", if that makes sense. I need a different "backbone" than the one my current database is using. Worked a bit also with my ideas for the UI and what that will look like. Some SQL work done and database seeded.

### After Coding

Overall, I feel good about my plans for the remake/reboot of this database. I think it will more accurately reflect the data I'm currently working with.
