### Before Coding

Feeling pretty relaxed. It's Saturday and I have coffee. Not much to complain about. I'm going into this round feeling fairly neutral.

### What I Did

I worked primarily on Project 8 for the Techdegree but also got a tip about a possible outside resource that I intend to look at later. I feel like the project is going well although I have had some issues with certain modules not wanting to run with the current version of Node.js

### After Coding

I feel like maybe I could have gotten more done, but I also feel like it's not so much my code as getting the different versions of things to work together properly. I still feel good that I did my one hour of code.

### Before Coding

I'm feeling like I need to do something different for today just to change it up a bit.

### What I Did

I decided to spend today working on algorithms and went to work on Edabit some. I got a couple of challenges completed and am feeling pretty good about that.

### After Coding

It was nice to have a day away from gulp and work with algorithms.

### Before Coding

Back to gulp and figuring out this versioning nonsense. I'm not looking forward to it, but I know that I need to press through this and others have done it, so I can too!

### What I Did

Worked with Node.js and gulp trying to get the `gulp-sass` module to work properly. No success yet. Might have to switch to something else. One of its dependencies is deprecated.

### After Coding

Still a bit frustrated with this project, but I'm glad that I put in my one hour. At least I know the source of the problem now. I thought it was my code. It isn't.

### Before Coding

Had a pretty terrific day at work today so I'm feeling good about coding. That being said, today I will be working on remodelling a database I designed and have had in production for over 2 years. However, the information I'm tracking with the database is changing dramatically and I need to redo/rethink how the db is designed.

### What I Did

Quite a bit of data modelling and working with MySQL workbench checking how things will connect to each other. I need the connections to be "looser", if that makes sense. I need a different "backbone" than the one my current database is using. Worked a bit also with my ideas for the UI and what that will look like. Some SQL work done and database seeded.

### After Coding

Overall, I feel good about my plans for the remake/reboot of this database. I think it will more accurately reflect the data I'm currently working with.

### Before Coding

Big victory at work today which makes me more inclined to work on this database for work.

### What I Did

Worked on the database and started fleshing out ideas for the UI. I have a fairly good idea of my data model now and now everything connects.

### After Coding

I feel pretty good about the work I did but unreasonably tired.

### Before Coding

I have a fever and am coughing, sneezing etc. I am not excited about doing this today and not feeleing very creative. Going to stick to my Project 8 requirements.

### What I Did

Worked on filling the requirements for Project 8. Specifically, I'm still trying to get `gulp-sass` to work with not much luck.

### After Coding

Tired, but glad that I tried even if there was no real progress.

### Before Coding

Still terribly ill. The fever hasn't broken, but I'm home from work today to rest up. Supervisor's orders.

### What I Did

Continued working on Project 8. Why can't I get this one thing to work?  No one else seems to be having problems. I don't get it. This thing is deprecated but I can't find anything to say what I should be using *instead*.

### After Coding

Frustrated and tired. I got nowhere. And I don't understand what I'm supposed to be using. Even the examples don't work.

### Before Coding

The fever is intermittent and I'm mostly just very tired. I decided to go back to work on my database. I'm thinking that a mock version of this might be my capstone project.

### What I Did

Fleshed out some fields in one of the tables where I think there might be some missing data. Also added a few intermediary tables to have many to many associations. This is getting complex but flexible.

### After Coding

I love working with databases and data. I just do. So I feel pretty good about today.
